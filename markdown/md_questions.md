# Study questions:
* How does the microbial community composition fluctuate over time as sinking particulates are exported from the euphotic zone? 
* How could changes to the microbial community over time impact the northern Gulf of Mexico biological carbon pump?
* How do biogeochemical fluxes directly alter the microbial community at the study site?
